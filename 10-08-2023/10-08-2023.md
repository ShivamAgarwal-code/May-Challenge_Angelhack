## Question

Given an integer string, create all integer permutations of its digits. Determine if there is a
permutation whose integer value is evenly divisible by 7, i.e. (permutation value) mod 7 = 0.
For example, the possible permutations of 789 are p = {789, 798, 879, 897, 978, 987}. Of
these values, p[2] and p[5] is divisible by 7 because 879 mod 7 = 0 and 987 mod 7 = 0.
Their average is (879 + 987) / 2 = 933
What youâ€™ll need to do is determine if any of the permutations of 1867 are divisible by 7, and
if so, what is the average between the smallest and largest permutation? Decimals are
allowed

## Solution

Yes, some permutations of 1867 are divisible by 7.
The average between largest and smallest permutation is 5152.
